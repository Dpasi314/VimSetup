# Overview
Simple bash files to allow for modification of local .vimrc and .vim files to be stored in a temporary location while I add my own custom vim mappings.
It's hard using other people's vim. :(

## WARNING
Bash will literally anything that I tell it to. All this power has be a little flustered so I'm not responsible if you lose your own vim bindings in place of mine.
But mine are pretty good, so I don't think you'll get disappointed
